## Problems 
1. **add_nums_known**: this program adds up all the numbers in a given set and it is known how many values are in the set, it calculates the minimum, maximum, average and total; it provides output via cleanly formatted `printf()` statements.

2. **add_nums_unkown**: this program adds up all the numbers in a given set, it is unknown how many numbers may exist in the set, it will calculate the minimum, maximum, average, and total; it provides outputs via cleanly formatted `printf()` statements.

3. **coordinates**: this program reads 2d coordinates from user input and indicates if those coordinates are within a 20x20 coordinate plane.

4. **rock_paper_scissors**: this program is a multi-file program that reads input from the user and sets up a game of rock, paper, scissors. 

5. **taylor_calculus**: this program approximates sine and cosine values using a modified taylor series.

6. **truth_tables**: this program sets up a series of truth tables for propositional values.
